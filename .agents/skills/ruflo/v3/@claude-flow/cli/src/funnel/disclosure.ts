/**
 * Existing-install disclosure gate — ADR-301, amended by ADR-311 to source
 * the disclosure MESSAGE itself from the remote feed rather than hardcoding
 * it in the CLI. Everything about WHETHER/WHEN to show a disclosure stays
 * local (state machine below); everything about WHAT it says comes from
 * the same remote pool as tips/promos, validated through the identical
 * ADR-301 content pipeline (isValidMessage in messages.ts).
 *
 * Invariants (release-blocking, tested):
 *   - No promotional content before disclosure.
 *   - The manage instruction appears in the disclosure text itself.
 *   - Shown once per user (user-level receipt), not once per project.
 *   - Declining disables all funnel surfaces (enforced in precedence.ts).
 *   - Fail-closed: if the remote feed has never successfully populated a
 *     disclosure-class message, there is nothing to show — no local
 *     fallback text exists (ADR-311 "zero local promo content").
 *
 * The disclosure text stays on the promo row for a grace window after its
 * first render so a single flash can't count as "the user was told"; only
 * after the window do promotional messages become eligible.
