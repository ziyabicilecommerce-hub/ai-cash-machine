/**
 * Local insight ticker — environment/task-aware suggestions sharing the
 * promo row's screen real estate, but a deliberately SEPARATE data path
 * from it.
 *
 * Why separate: the promo row is "zero local content, fully remote-served,
 * fail-closed" (an explicit earlier design call — nothing about WHAT shows
 * ships in the package). Insights are the opposite by nature — CVE counts,
 * uncommitted changes, sponsored-mode state — none of that is knowable
 * server-side. Conflating the two would mean either routing local logic
 * through the remote-content validation pipeline (messages.ts's
 * isValidMessage(), built for untrusted REMOTE content) or quietly giving
 * the promo row a second, unrelated job. So: same rendered slot, same
 * PromoRow shape, but a totally separate module, never touching
 * message-transport.ts or the remote message cache.
 *
 * Cheapness discipline (learned the hard way — see the funnel-cache fix):
 * every insight source here MUST be either (a) synchronous local file/state
 * reads, already-computed data the caller passes in, or (b) a read of a
 * cache some OTHER, separately-scheduled process populates. NEVER a network
 * call from here — that would reintroduce the exact bug where a statusline
 * render silently ate a multi-second fetch it could never actually finish.
