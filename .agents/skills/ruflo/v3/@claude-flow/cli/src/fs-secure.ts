/**
 * Restricted-permission file helpers.
 *
 * audit_1776853149979: session/memory/terminal stores were written with the
 * process umask, which on most macOS/Linux setups leaves them world-readable
 * (mode 0644). They contain conversation snapshots, agent prompts, and
 * terminal command history — anyone else on the host can read them.
 *
 * These helpers write atomically and force mode 0600 (files) / 0700 (dirs).
 * chmod fails silently on Windows, where POSIX modes don't apply — that's
 * fine, the OS-level ACL surface there is different.
 *
 * ADR-096 Phase 2: optional opt-in encryption-at-rest. When the caller
 * passes `encrypt: true` AND the env-gated vault is enabled, payloads are
 * AES-256-GCM-encrypted before hitting disk. Reads use the magic-byte
 * sniff so legacy plaintext files keep working unchanged during the
 * incremental migration.

 * Crash-safe atomic file write (issue #2584).
 *
 * A plain `writeFileSync(dbPath, db.export())` of a large sql.js image is NOT
 * crash-safe: a kill/OOM mid-write — or a second process rewriting the same
 * path concurrently — leaves a half-written image, and reopening it yields
 * `database disk image is malformed`. The corruption window scales with file
 * size, so a 185 MB monolithic flush is especially exposed.
 *
 * This writes to a unique temp sibling, fsyncs the bytes to disk, then
 * `rename()`s over the target. rename() is atomic on POSIX within one
 * filesystem, so a reader/reopen sees either the old complete image or the new
 * complete image — never a torn one. The directory entry is best-effort fsynced
 * so the rename itself survives a crash. On any failure the temp file is
 * removed and the original is left untouched.
