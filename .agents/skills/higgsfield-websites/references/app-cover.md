# App cover + OG image (3:2, Higgsfield brand style)

Generate the launch cover for an app/website — the image behind `og_image_url`
and the marketplace card — in 3:2, using `higgsfield generate create gpt_image_2`,
guided by the hosted reference covers listed in the
workflow below. Also use this when the user directly asks for a
"cover", "кавер", "обложка", "OG image", "launch cover" or "thumbnail" for a
product, model, feature or app announcement.

Every request produces TWO output files **from ONE generation** (same pixels
in both):

1. **`<name>_cover.png`** — the plain cover: the generated full-bleed artwork
   as-is (for marketplaces and previews).
2. **`<name>_og.png`** — the OG image: the exact same artwork masked by
   `scripts/compose_cover.py` into a solid frame + geometrically perfect
   stadium capsule + corner dots. Image models cannot draw a true pill shape,
   so the frame geometry is always done in code, never by the model.

Because the OG mask crops the outer ~8% of the art (most at the corners and
the capsule's rounded ends), the generation prompt must insist that all text
and the focal subject stay inside the central safe zone. If something
important still lands under the mask, regenerate — don't ship a cover with
clipped text.

## The brand style (what makes these covers recognizable)

Every reference cover follows the same visual system. Reproduce it unless the
user asks to deviate:

- **Solid vivid background frame** filling the whole canvas — acid
  lime/chartreuse is the signature color; yellow, green, olive, peach, or soft
  gray also appear. Small decorative dots sit near the corners of the frame.
- **A large stadium-shaped capsule (true pill shape)** inset from the edges,
  containing the hero scene: end caps are perfect semicircles, corner radius
  equals half the capsule height. This shape is drawn by
  `scripts/compose_cover.py`, not by the image model. The capsule holds either
  a cinematic/photoreal scene, a clean studio composition, or a playful 3D
  render.
- **Big display typography** for the product name — the name is the loudest
  element after the hero. This is where covers most often die into AI slop, so
  treat type as a designed composition, not a caption. Three hard rules:
  1. **Typeface**: vary deliberately between covers — bold condensed uppercase
     is ALLOWED ONLY for genuinely loud/sporty launches and must not be the
     default. The palette of treatments: glossy chrome bubble lowercase
     (Y2K/cute), elegant serif with italic accents (editorial/analytical),
     pixelated 8-bit (techy/retro), clean modern grotesk lowercase
     (product/utility), stencil/slab (industrial), handwritten brush
     (personal/creative), whimsical storybook serif (kids/cozy). Name the
     treatment explicitly in the prompt.
  2. **Type composition**: don't just park one straight line of text on the
     left. Compose: stack words in two-three lines with contrasting sizes (one
     word huge, the rest small), mix filled and outlined letters, tilt or arc a
     word, let one word sit inside/behind the hero so the subject overlaps a
     letter (depth), run the tagline vertically or as a small badge, put one
     word in a contrasting color. Pick ONE such compositional idea per cover
     and describe it concretely.
  3. **Title color comes from the scene's palette** — not automatically acid
     lime. Lime titles only when the scene is genuinely dark/neutral and lime
     fits the vibe.
- **A small rounded pill CTA** reading "Available now at higgsfield.ai" in
  small clean type.
- **Higgsfield logo** (squiggle mark + wordmark) placed near the title, small.
  Partner logos (e.g., "Higgsfield MCP × Claude") appear as a compact lockup
  above the title when relevant.
- Hero imagery is high-production: dramatic light, punchy contrast, tasteful
  humor or spectacle (goalkeeper diving, office slapstick, neon subway,
  claymation shark). One clear focal subject — never a collage of equal
  elements.

## Anti-slop rules (composition)

These are the patterns that make AI covers look cheap — actively design
against them:

- **No default layout.** "Hero on the right, straight title on the left,
  everything vertically centered" is the slop baseline. Vary: hero breaking
  through the center with type wrapped around it, title huge across the whole
  width with the subject in front of it, low horizon with type in the sky,
  extreme close-up hero with a small precise type block in a corner of the safe
  zone.
- **Scale contrast.** Something should be dramatically big against something
  small — a giant hero vs a tiny type block, or a massive one-word title vs a
  small scene.
- **Depth, not decals.** Let the hero overlap a letter or the title cast onto
  the scene; text should feel placed IN the world's lighting, not pasted on
  top.
- **Restraint with effects.** No generic glows, lens flares, floating sparks,
  or particle confetti "for energy" unless the concept demands them. One strong
  lighting idea beats five effects.
- **Specific beats generic.** In the scene description name concrete materials,
  a concrete camera angle, and one concrete lighting setup — vague words
  ("epic", "dynamic") produce slop.

## Workflow

### 1. Get the essentials from the request

You need: the **product/feature name** (exact spelling — it will be rendered
as text), a **hero concept** (the focal scene), and a **typography treatment**
matching the vibe (see the style section — vary it between covers). For an app
build, derive the name from `og_title` and the hero concept from what the app
does.

**Keep `og_title` SHORT — at most 3–4 words, and ideally ONE word.** It is the
feed-card title and the browser tab title, and it's the dominant text on the
cover, so a punchy one- or two-word product/brand name reads best (e.g. `Lumen`,
`PixelForge`, `Recipe Vault`). Put the pitch/tagline in `og_description`, never
in `og_title` — an `og_title` that's a full sentence is wrong.

If the user gave only a name, invent a hero concept that fits the
product's vibe (playful spectacle > generic tech imagery). Optional: accent
color, partner lockup, CTA text override.

### 2. Pick 2–4 reference images

References are hosted at
`https://static.higgsfield.ai/website-builder/og-image-references/ref_01.jpg`
… `ref_11.jpg` (same pattern for every file below):

| File | Layout | Vibe |
|---|---|---|
| ref_01 | landscape | lime frame, neon subway, anime character — dark/cinematic |
| ref_02 | landscape | lime frame, stadium goalkeeper — sporty, dramatic |
| ref_03 | landscape | peach frame, light studio, glass cards — clean/technical |
| ref_04 | landscape | olive frame, office slapstick photo — comedic |
| ref_05, ref_06 | vertical | full-bleed 9:16 versions (no capsule) — style only |
| ref_07 | landscape | green frame, butterflies, light — fresh/friendly |
| ref_08 | landscape | sage frame, claymation shark — playful/craft |
| ref_09 | landscape | yellow frame, office banana slapstick — comedic |
| ref_10 | landscape | gray frame, app cards fan — product UI focus |
| ref_11 | vertical | orange gradient, K-pop portrait — style only |

Default choice: 2–3 landscape refs whose vibe matches the requested cover
(e.g., comedic request → ref_04 + ref_09 + one lime ref for the frame). Always
include at least one lime-frame ref (ref_01/ref_02) unless the user asks for
another palette, since lime is the signature.

### 3. Reference the chosen refs

The generate command's `--image` flag accepts a direct http(s) URL (the CLI
auto-imports it), so pass the chosen ref URLs straight to the generation in
step 4 — no separate upload step. If you prefer to pre-import them,
`higgsfield upload create <url> …` returns an id per file that you can reuse as
a `--image` value.

### 4. Generate ONE full-bleed artwork

Call `higgsfield generate create` once, passing the chosen refs as repeated
`--image` flags:

```bash
higgsfield generate create gpt_image_2 \
  --aspect_ratio 3:2 --quality high --resolution 2k --count 1 \
  --image https://static.higgsfield.ai/website-builder/og-image-references/ref_01.jpg \
  --image https://static.higgsfield.ai/website-builder/og-image-references/ref_02.jpg \
  --prompt "<see template>" --wait
```

Prompt template — fill the brackets, keep the structure. The safe-zone
sentence is what protects the OG mask step; keep it:

> Full-bleed promo artwork in the visual style of the scenes inside the
> reference images' capsules, edge-to-edge composition filling the entire
> canvas, NO border, NO frame, NO rounded capsule, NO corner dots. Scene:
> [HERO CONCEPT — one focal subject, concrete materials, concrete camera
> angle, one concrete lighting setup]. Title "[PRODUCT NAME]" in [TYPOGRAPHY
> TREATMENT], [TITLE COLOR drawn from the scene palette]; type composition:
> [TYPE COMPOSITION — e.g. "stacked in two lines, first word three times
> larger than the second" / "the hero overlaps the bottom of the letters" /
> "one word tilted 4 degrees, outlined, the rest filled"]. Small tagline
> "[TAGLINE]". Small rounded pill button with the text "Available now at
> higgsfield.ai". Small Higgsfield logo near the title. IMPORTANT: keep the
> title, tagline, button, logo and the focal subject inside the central safe
> zone — nothing closer than 10% to any edge, corners empty (background only)
> — the outer edges will be cropped by a rounded mask. 3:2 landscape
> composition, punchy contrast, premium promo art.

Before generating, sanity-check your own plan: if the draft is "condensed caps,
lime, left-aligned, hero on the right" — that's the slop baseline, redesign the
type composition first.

Text rendering matters: repeat the exact product name in quotes and keep other
text minimal — GPT Image renders short strings well but degrades with many
labels.

### 5. Produce the two outputs

The raw artwork IS `<name>_cover.png` — save it as-is. Then build the OG image
from the same file with the compose script at the END of this document: write
it to `compose_cover.py` in your workspace verbatim, then run it (needs
Pillow + numpy — `pip install pillow numpy` if missing):

```bash
python3 compose_cover.py \
  --art <name>_cover.png --out <name>_og.png \
  --frame-color "#D9FF2E" --dot-color "#1A1A1A"
```

The script masks the art into a perfect stadium capsule, paints the frame and
corner dots. Pick `--frame-color` to complement the art: signature acid lime
`#D9FF2E`, pastel sky-blue `#A9CFF4`, yellow `#F5C518`, olive `#7A7D3C`, peach
`#F7DDB9`. `--dot-color` should read clearly against the frame (dark `#1A1A1A`
on light frames, white or pastel on saturated ones). Other flags:
`--margin-x/--margin-y` (capsule inset), `--no-dots`.

Do NOT image-analyze or visually inspect the composed OG result — keeping the
title/logo inside the safe zone at generation time (above) is what prevents
mask-clipping. The compose flags let you adjust framing without regenerating if
you already know it needs it: `--offset-x/--offset-y` shift the art (e.g.
`--offset-x -70` pulls a right-hugging title inward) and `--shrink 0.92` scales
it down; revealed gaps get filled with a blurred extension of the art, invisible
on dark or soft backgrounds. (Legacy: `--detect` mode handles art that already
contains a model-drawn frame.)

### 6. Deliver / wire into the app

- **Standalone cover request**: show both files to the user and save them to
  their folder if one is connected.
- **App/website build (the publish gate)**: upload BOTH files with
  `higgsfield upload create` and set the returned durable URLs in
  `app/src/app-meta.json`: `<name>_og.png` → `og_image_url`,
  `<name>_cover.png` → `marketplace_cover_url`. Commit before running
  `higgsfield website publish`.

If the text came out garbled, regenerate once with the flaw named explicitly
in the prompt (e.g., "the title must read exactly ..."), then re-run the
compose step.

## Deviations

The user's explicit wishes always beat the defaults above: different aspect
ratio, no capsule, another CTA, partner lockups ("Higgsfield MCP × Claude"
style), vertical format (then use ref_05/06/11 as refs). The brand system is
the default, not a cage.

## compose_cover.py (write this file verbatim, then run it)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Build the OG version of a Higgsfield-style app cover from full-bleed art.

Takes the full-bleed artwork (which is itself the plain marketplace cover)
and produces the OG image: solid color frame + the art masked into a
geometrically perfect stadium (pill) capsule + small corner dots.
The stadium's end caps are perfect semicircles (radius = half height) —
image models can't draw this reliably, so it is done in code, on the exact
same pixels as the plain cover.

Usage:
  python3 compose_cover.py --art plain_cover.png --out cover_og.png \
      --frame-color "#D9FF2E" --dot-color "#1A1A1A"

Modes:
  default        — the art is full-bleed: it is masked into the capsule.
  --detect       — the art already contains a model-drawn frame+capsule:
                   the capsule is auto-detected and its geometry perfected.
