# scroll-scrub — seam-locked camera journeys (`--type website` only)

Use this reference when the brief asks for a scrollable world, continuous
camera journey, diorama fly-through, browse-through-the-industry site, or a
landing page where scrolling flies through several connected scenes. Select
**A4 — Seam-locked scroll scrub** in `references/wow-catalog.md`.

This is a specialized website build, not a Higgsfield app. Generate the scene
media with Higgsfield during the build, download it into the site, and ship a
standalone branded website that performs no runtime generation, uses no fnf
SDK, and mentions no Higgsfield branding.

The bundled Markdown assets provide an SSR-safe React/TanStack implementation,
layout contract, and deterministic video helper. Keep them in `references/`;
materialize only the fenced code needed by the generated site.

## Fit it into the existing website pipeline

Keep the single intake call and every normal website phase. Do not add a second
interview. Resolve missing details in the existing intake or choose defaults in
the design brief.

### Phase 0 — lock the journey

Write these A4-specific decisions into `app/design-brief.md`:

- **Journey:** order 4–7 scenes as a real narrative or value chain. Give each
  scene a physical subject, one focal point, one short headline, one sentence,
  and at most 0–3 proof tags. Keep the existing eyebrow ration; do not turn
  every scene label into an eyebrow.
- **World grammar:** lock one byte-identical style preamble, perspective,
  palette, light direction, surface finish, and background behavior across all
  scene prompts. Change only the scene subject and focal action.
- **Camera architecture:** choose A or B below. Default to A for grounded,
  realistic, architectural, product, and first-person work. Use B only when
  the world is explicitly miniature, isometric, map-like, or toy-like.
- **Mobile framing:** include mobile by default, without another question.
  Keep every focal point inside the center-safe area and plan lighter mobile
  encodes. Use a separately generated portrait source only when center-safe
  composition cannot preserve a critical scene.
- **Cost shape:** record one entry image plus `N` sequential video legs for A,
  or `N` scene images plus `N` dives and `N-1` connectors for B. The per-scene
  Phase 1 boards already art-direct A's destinations; do not buy unused
  destination stills that cannot participate in its exact-frame handoff. This
  is a deliberate media-heavy cinema build.
- **Delivery budget:** record an aggregate byte budget in the brief. Start at
  ≤32 MiB for all desktop clips and ≤16 MiB for all mobile clips; shorten or
  re-encode before relaxing it.

### Phase 1 — make each board a world chapter

Generate one board per scene as usual. Make the boards prove that the chapters
belong to one world: keep camera height, vanishing logic, material language,
palette, and light coherent while varying the subject. Annotate the intended
entry direction, focal point, and exit direction in the written brief, not as
text inside the generated image.

Compose boards and generation-source stills center-safe. Keep essential subjects
away from the far left/right edges because the full-viewport video deliberately
uses `cover` on portrait screens. Generate a separate portrait source only for a
scene whose story cannot survive that crop.

### Phase 2 — build the seam-locked media chain

Use the Higgsfield CLI already used by the website flow:

1. Run `higgsfield model list` and `higgsfield model get <job_type>` for the
   current image/video schemas. Require the exact media roles the chosen
   architecture needs; do not rely on a remembered model roster or invent
   `--start-image`/`--end-image` support.
2. For A, submit only the entry-still candidates as async
   `higgsfield generate create <image_job_type> ...` jobs. For B, submit all
   independent scene stills up front. Reuse the locked style preamble verbatim,
   name concrete scene props, request no text/logos/watermarks, and keep the
   focal point centered.
3. Poll with `higgsfield generate wait <job_id>` / `higgsfield generate get
   <job_id>` because their outputs are downstream inputs. Keep the approved
   full-size source stills in scratch space. They are generation inputs/art
   direction, not runtime posters; deployed posters come from the exact encoded
   clips below.
4. Generate the video chain with one qualifying model and one visual grade.
   Never mix models mid-chain merely to save time: their grain, color, and
   motion signatures create a visible seam even when position matches.
5. Poll and download every source MP4. Read
   `references/scroll-scrub-asset-video.md`, copy its fenced Bash into
   `/tmp/scroll-scrub-video.sh`, then use that deterministic helper for
   boundary frames and scrub encodes:

   ```bash
   bash /tmp/scroll-scrub-video.sh bounds source.mp4 /tmp/scene-a
   bash /tmp/scroll-scrub-video.sh desktop source.mp4 app/public/assets/world/scene-a.mp4
   bash /tmp/scroll-scrub-video.sh mobile source.mp4 app/public/assets/world/scene-a-mobile.mp4
   bash /tmp/scroll-scrub-video.sh poster app/public/assets/world/scene-a.mp4 app/public/assets/world/scene-a-poster.png
   bash /tmp/scroll-scrub-video.sh poster app/public/assets/world/scene-a-mobile.mp4 app/public/assets/world/scene-a-mobile-poster.png
   ```

   `bounds` writes `<prefix>-first.png` and `<prefix>-last.png`. Pass a boundary
   frame's local path directly to the next `higgsfield generate create`
   `--start-image`/`--end-image` flag; the CLI auto-uploads it. The public
   poster commands run AFTER encoding, so each `poster`/`mobilePoster` matches
   the first frame of the exact clip the browser will decode.

#### Architecture A — continuous forward flight (default)

Generate the legs sequentially:

1. Start leg 1 from the approved scene-1 still using the selected model's
   documented start-frame role.
2. Extract the completed leg's ACTUAL last rendered frame, upload it, and use
   that exact frame as the next leg's start. Never use a Phase 1 board or an
   independently imagined destination still as the seam handoff or runtime
   poster.
3. Do not constrain the next leg with a wide end frame. Prompt it to continue
   the same gentle forward velocity into the next scene. Allow an orbit,
   lateral track, crane, or detail push inside a leg, but make the final second
   settle into the same slow forward drift that the following leg begins with.
4. Inspect the last frame before spending on the next leg. Re-roll a leg that
   ends mid-orbit, with sideways blur, or facing the wrong exit direction.

Position continuity comes from the exact-frame handoff; velocity continuity
comes from matching the direction and speed on both sides. Both are required.
Wire the legs directly as scene segments; no connector clips exist in A.

#### Architecture B — diorama dives plus aerial connectors

Use this only when pulling back to a world map is part of the concept:

1. Generate all scene dives independently from their approved stills. A dive
   begins outside/above the miniature and moves into its focal point.
2. Extract the ACTUAL last frame of dive `i` and ACTUAL first frame of dive
   `i+1`.
3. Generate connector `i` from those two uploaded boundary frames using the
   exact start/end roles reported by the current model schema. Batch all
   connectors once their boundaries exist.
4. Make the connector pull out of scene `i`, cross the connected miniature
   world, and begin descending into scene `i+1`.

Require both equalities at every join:

```text
dive[i].last pixels == connector[i].start pixels
connector[i].end pixels == dive[i+1].first pixels
```

Use a very short crossfade only as insurance against encoder/model drift. A
crossfade cannot repair a wrong endpoint or the grounded-world rewind created
by a forward dive followed by a backward pull-out; switch that concept to A.

### Encode direct MP4s for scrubbing

Scrub the optimized MP4 chain directly. Do not export thousands of frame images
for A4.

- Desktop: preserve native resolution, H.264/yuv420p, CRF about 20, GOP 8,
  scene-cut keyframes disabled, audio removed, `faststart` enabled.
- Mobile: cap height at 720px, CRF about 23, GOP 4, audio removed, `faststart`
  enabled. A tighter GOP reduces decoder work during repeated seeks.
- Extract a mandatory poster from the first frame of every final desktop clip,
  including connectors. Extract `mobilePoster` from every mobile clip. Never
  substitute the next scene's still or show a black video box while a clip
  downloads or before iOS paints its first decoded frame.
- Store only selected, encoded assets in `app/public/`; keep raw clips,
  boundary frames, and rejects outside public assets.
- Measure both encoded chains against the brief's aggregate byte budget. The
  controller retains visited Blob assets to keep reverse scroll smooth, so
  oversized clips become memory cost as well as transfer cost.

The A4 entry still, exact deployed-segment posters, and chained MP4s replace the
ordinary cinema hero scrub and cover the hero/content imagery for these
chapters. Continue generating the normal logo, icons, section UI assets, head
kit, and OG assets, but do not spend on a redundant second hero film.

### Phase 3 — assemble the SSR-safe React page

Read both bundled code assets and adapt them:

- `references/scroll-scrub-asset-react.md` — semantic React chapters plus the
  scrub controller (lazy nearby clip loading, Blob seekability, seek
  coalescing, iOS priming, mobile sources, active-section navigation, full
  teardown).
- `references/scroll-scrub-asset-css.md` — layout contract only. Replace its
  composition values through the design brief; do not add generic shared CTA
  chrome.

Extract the fenced sources into
`app/src/components/scroll-scrub/scroll-scrub.tsx` and
`app/src/components/scroll-scrub/scroll-scrub.css`, then provide real scene
data. Render each scene's CTA as its own `actions` node/component from the
brief's CTA inventory. Keep all chapter copy server-rendered in ordinary
semantic `<article>` flow; the client controller owns media time only. Never
drive per-frame values through React state. Keep the `scenes`/`connectors`
arrays as module constants or memoize them in the parent; changing their
identity intentionally rebuilds the controller.

The React asset intentionally does not build a header, generic button system,
scroll hint, or one eyebrow per scene. Compose the site's own nav and bespoke
CTAs around it. Keep the media controller inside `useEffect`; no browser global
may run during SSR.

### Phase 4 — motion and interaction

Let the A4 controller own scroll-to-video time for the scrub stage. Keep the
normal Lenis-to-GSAP ticker bridge for other cinema motion, but do not attach a
second scrub timeline to the same video elements. Use transform-only entrance
motion for surrounding chrome, keep chapter copy fully rendered, and preserve
the initial poster before client initialization.

Support reverse scroll as a first-class path. Every seam that works only in the
forward direction is still broken.

## Runtime requirements

- Fetch same-origin clips to Blob URLs before scrubbing so `currentTime` remains
  seekable even when byte-range behavior differs. Fall back to the poster if a
  clip fails.
- Add `blob:` to the site's CSP `media-src` because the controller assigns Blob
  URLs to `<video src>`. Keep clip fetches same-origin, with `connect-src 'self'`.
  A CSP that allows only `media-src 'self' https:` is incomplete here.
- Load only the active/nearby segment, keep its poster until `loadeddata` plus a
  real painted/seeked frame, and coalesce seeks while `video.seeking` is true. A
  failed source settles on its poster without a retry loop.
- Prime muted inline videos on the first pointer/touch gesture for iOS, then
  pause them; scrolling controls time, never autoplay.
- Ignore touch-browser height-only resize events caused by URL chrome; relayout
  on width/orientation changes and replace an already loaded desktop/mobile
  Blob when the selected source changes.
- Respect safe areas and use `dvh`. Keep focal media center-safe on mobile.
- Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, skip all video fetch/decode and present the
  same semantic chapters over static posters.
- On unmount, abort pending fetches, remove listeners, cancel animation frames,
  remove created video nodes, and revoke every Blob URL.

## A4 pre-delivery QA

Complete all normal Phase 5 checks, then verify:

Run the interactive A4 checks against local preview BEFORE the one final deploy.
They are pre-delivery build QA, not permission for a second deploy or a
post-deploy production browsing pass.

- Every seam uses an actual rendered boundary frame; inspect just before and
  after the seam in both scroll directions.
- Camera velocity does not reverse unintentionally across an A seam. B's
  pull-out is visibly intentional and used only for a miniature/map world.
- `currentTime` follows scroll across every segment; a fast flick does not
  build a seek backlog or freeze playback.
- First paint and every unloaded/failed clip show the exact deployed clip's
  first-frame poster, never a destination still, black box, or blank media.
- Desktop loads desktop encodes; a 375px/coarse-pointer viewport loads mobile
  encodes. Test portrait crop, safe areas, rotation, and a 4–6× CPU-throttled
  fast scroll.
- Reduced motion performs zero video fetches and keeps the full story usable.
- Route buttons are keyboard accessible, active state is not hover-only, and
  chapter headings remain in DOM/reading order.
- React unmount/remount produces no duplicate listeners, live RAF loop, stale
  video node, or unreleased Blob URL.
- The measured desktop/mobile clip totals stay inside the brief's byte budgets;
  verify requests and decoder behavior under network throttling as well as CPU
  throttling.
